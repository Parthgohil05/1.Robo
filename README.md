This is a simple Text-to-Speech (TTS) application using the `pyttsx3` library. It allows users to input text which is then converted to speech.

## Features

- Continuous input loop until manually stopped

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyttsx3` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-speech.git
   cd text-to-speech
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required library:**

   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script:**

   ```bash

   ```

2. **Enter the text you want to convert to speech:**

   The script will continuously prompt you to enter text. Type your text and press Enter to hear it spoken out loud.

   ```plaintext

   ```

3. **To exit the script, you can manually stop it using `Ctrl+C`.**

## Example

```plaintext
What you want to speak?? Hello, how are you?

The application will then convert "Hello, how are you?" to speech.
